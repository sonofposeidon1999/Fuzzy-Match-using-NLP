# Fuzzy-Match-using-NLP
A similarity text is used to get a match of Bank statement and Bank ledger narration.
Token Set Ratio is a function in fuzzywuzzy module in python where we can have a score out of 100 that denotes two string are equal by giving similarity index.
It uses Levenshtein Distance to calculate the differences between sequences.	

Implementation

1.	The Ledger narration and Bank statement is extracted from the 2 excel sheets respectively.

2.	Pre-processing of Ledger Narration and Bank Statement is done using NLTK(Natural Language Tool Kit):
•	Removal of punctuations

•	Converting to lower case

•	Removal of stop words

•	Removal of top 5 frequent words


3.	A list of ledger narrations are mapped to every Bank statement based on amount.

4.	Fuzzy is implemented on the Ledger narration and its respective Bank statement and the max score is considered as the top match amongst the ledger narrations.  

The final output is the Bank statement and its matched ledger narration with the score generated by fuzzy in a new excel sheet.
60%-100% was chosen as the best fuzzy matching for Bank statement and Ledger Narration.
